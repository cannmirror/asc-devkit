# type_traits Type Traits Direct Call Sample
## Overview
This sample implements type_traits type traits use cases using the Ascend C programming language. Type traits interfaces include is_void, remove_const, add_const, and so on. It uses the <<<>>> kernel call operator to complete the basic flow of running and verifying operator kernel functions on the NPU side, providing corresponding end-to-end implementations.

## Function Description
- type_traits type traits interfaces include is_void, is_integral, is_floating_point, is_array, is_pointer, is_reference, is_const, remove_const, remove_volatile, remove_cv, remove_reference, remove_pointer, add_const, add_volatile, add_cv, add_pointer, add_lvalue_reference, and add_rvalue_reference. These interfaces can be used for type checking, addition, removal, and conversion during program compilation.

- Operator Implementation:
  - Kernel Implementation
    Ascend C calls each interface and prints the interface return value and ascendc_assert judgment.

  - Call Implementation
    Use the kernel call operator <<<>>> to call the kernel function.

## Build and Run
Execute the following steps in the root directory of this sample to build and run the operator.
- Configure Environment Variables
  Please select the corresponding command to configure environment variables based on the [installation method](../../../../../docs/en/quick_start.md#prepare&install) of the CANN development kit package on the current environment.
  - Default path, root user installed CANN software package
    ```bash
    source /usr/local/Ascend/cann/set_env.sh
    ```

  - Default path, non-root user installed CANN software package
    ```bash
    source $HOME/Ascend/cann/set_env.sh
    ```

  - Specified path install_path, installed CANN software package
    ```bash
    source ${install_path}/cann/set_env.sh
    ```
    
- Sample Execution
  ```bash
  mkdir -p build && cd build;   # Create and enter build directory
  cmake ..;make -j;             # Build project
  ./demo                        # Execute the compiled executable program to run the sample
  ```
  The final execution result is as follows, indicating successful execution.
  ```bash
  test pass!
  ```
