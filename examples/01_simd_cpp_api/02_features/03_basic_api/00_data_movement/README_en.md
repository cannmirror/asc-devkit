# Data Movement API Sample Introduction

## Overview

This directory contains samples for multiple APIs related to data movement. Each sample is based on Ascend C's <<<>>> direct call method, supporting implementation of main function and kernel function in the same cpp file.

## Sample List

| Directory Name | Function Description |
| ----------------------------------------------------------| -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [broadcast_ub2l0c](./broadcast_ub2l0c) | This sample implements data broadcast movement based on BroadCastVecToMM, broadcasting data located on UB (Unified Buffer) and moving it to CO1 (L0C Buffer) |
| [copy_ub2ub](./copy_ub2ub) | This sample implements data movement based on Copy, applicable for data movement between VECIN and VECOUT, supporting mask continuous mode and counter mode |
| [data_copy_gm2l1](./data_copy_gm2l1) | This sample introduces how to use DataCopy to move input data from GM (Global Memory) to L1 (L1 Buffer) |
| [data_copy_gm2ub_slice](./data_copy_gm2ub_slice) | This sample implements data slice movement based on DataCopy, extracting subsets of multi-dimensional Tensor data for movement between GM (Global Memory) and UB (Unified Buffer) pathways |
| [data_copy_gm2ub_nddma](./data_copy_gm2ub_nddma) | This sample introduces how to use multi-dimensional data movement interface to implement data movement from GM (Global Memory) to UB (Unified Buffer) pathway.

| [ld_st_reg_mask](./ld_st_reg_mask) | This sample implements UB (Unified Buffer) load/store operations to MaskReg (mask register) using Reg programming interface, and mask-based masked store operations |
| [ld_st_reg_align](./ld_st_reg_align) | This sample implements aligned data movement operations (continuous and non-continuous) from UB (Unified Buffer) to RegTensor (Reg vector computation basic unit) using Reg programming interface |
| [ld_st_reg_unalign](./ld_st_reg_unalign) | This sample implements unaligned data movement operations from UB (Unified Buffer) to RegTensor (Reg vector computation basic unit) using Reg programming interface |
| [gather_ld_reg](./gather_ld_reg) | This sample demonstrates using Gather interface to implement discrete data load, including high-dimensional Gather (source is LocalTensor) and Reg::GatherB (collect by DataBlock) scenarios |
| [scatter_st_reg](./scatter_st_reg) | This sample demonstrates using Reg::Scatter interface to implement discrete data store (scatter elements to UB) |
| [auxscalar_reg](./auxscalar_reg) | This sample demonstrates using AuxScalar method to read multiple scalar data from UB for computation |
