# HelloWorld Sample

## Overview

This sample demonstrates the basic workflow of running and verifying a kernel function on the NPU side using the `<<<>>>` kernel invocation operator. The kernel function prints output results via `printf`.

## Supported Products

- Ascend 950PR/Ascend 950DT
- Atlas A3 Training Series Products/Atlas A3 Inference Series Products
- Atlas A2 Training Series Products/Atlas A2 Inference Series Products

## Build and Run

Execute the following steps in the sample root directory to build and run the sample.

- Configure Environment Variables  
  Select the appropriate command to configure environment variables based on the [installation method](../../../../../docs/en/quick_start.md#prepare&install) of the CANN development kit on your current environment.
  - Default path, root user installed CANN software package
    ```bash
    source /usr/local/Ascend/cann/set_env.sh
    ```

  - Default path, non-root user installed CANN software package
    ```bash
    source $HOME/Ascend/cann/set_env.sh
    ```

  - Specified path install_path, installed CANN software package
    ```bash
    source ${install_path}/cann/set_env.sh
    ```

- Sample Execution
  ```bash
  mkdir -p build && cd build;
  cmake -DCMAKE_ASC_ARCHITECTURES=dav-2201 ..;make -j;                      # Build project (default npu mode)
  ./demo
  ```

  When using CPU debug or NPU simulation mode, add `-DCMAKE_ASC_RUN_MODE=cpu` or `-DCMAKE_ASC_RUN_MODE=sim` parameter.

  Examples:
  ```bash
  cmake -DCMAKE_ASC_RUN_MODE=cpu -DCMAKE_ASC_ARCHITECTURES=dav-2201 ..;make -j; # CPU debug mode
  cmake -DCMAKE_ASC_RUN_MODE=sim -DCMAKE_ASC_ARCHITECTURES=dav-2201 ..;make -j; # NPU simulation mode
  ```

  For detailed information about CPU debugging, please refer to [03_cpudebug sample](../../../01_utilities/03_cpudebug).

  > **Note:** Before switching build modes, clean the cmake cache by running `rm CMakeCache.txt` in the build directory, then re-run cmake.

- Build Options
  | Option | Values | Description |
  |--------|--------|-------------|
  | `CMAKE_ASC_RUN_MODE` | `npu` (default), `cpu`, `sim` | Run mode: NPU execution, CPU debug, NPU simulation |
  | `CMAKE_ASC_ARCHITECTURES` | `dav-2201` (default), `dav-3510` | NPU architecture: dav-2201 corresponds to Atlas A2 Training Series Products/Atlas A2 Inference Series Products and Atlas A3 Training Series Products/Atlas A3 Inference Series Products, dav-3510 corresponds to Ascend 950PR/Ascend 950DT |

- Execution Result  
  The following output indicates successful execution:
  
  ```bash
