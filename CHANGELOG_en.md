### 📖 Documentation
- Added 90+ [Reg programming interface API](https://gitcode.com/cann/asc-devkit/blob/9.0.0-beta.2/docs/api/context/Reg%E7%9F%A2%E9%87%8F%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97.md) documentation. Reg vector computation API is developed for RegBase architecture, allowing users to directly operate registers involved in Vector computation on the chip for greater flexibility and better performance.
- Added SIMT [quick start](https://www.hiascend.com/document/detail/zh/CANNCommunityEdition/900beta2/opdevg/Ascendcopdevg/atlas_ascendc_map_10_0022.html), [programming model](https://www.hiascend.com/document/detail/zh/CANNCommunityEdition/900beta2/opdevg/Ascendcopdevg/atlas_ascendc_10_10064.html), and [operator implementation](https://www.hiascend.com/document/detail/zh/CANNCommunityEdition/900beta2/opdevg/Ascendcopdevg/atlasascendc_api_07_10293.html) introductions.
- Added SIMD and SIMT [hybrid programming model](https://www.hiascend.com/document/detail/zh/CANNCommunityEdition/900beta2/opdevg/Ascendcopdevg/atlas_ascendc_10_10052.html), [operator implementation](https://www.hiascend.com/document/detail/zh/CANNCommunityEdition/900beta2/opdevg/Ascendcopdevg/atlas_ascendc_10_10039.html), and [performance optimization](https://www.hiascend.com/document/detail/zh/CANNCommunityEdition/900beta2/opdevg/Ascendcopdevg/atlas_ascendc_best_practices_10_10029.html) introductions.
- Added [SIMT API](https://www.hiascend.com/document/detail/zh/CANNCommunityEdition/900beta2/API/ascendcopapi/atlasascendc_api_07_0427.html) documentation section.
- Added [compatibility migration guide](https://www.hiascend.com/document/detail/zh/CANNCommunityEdition/900beta2/opdevg/Ascendcopdevg/atlas_ascendc_compatibility_10_00001.html) (220x architecture version migration to 351x architecture version).
- In Ascend community, Ascend C operator development added [visualization zone](https://www.hiascend.com/document/detail/zh/CANNCommunityEdition/900beta2/opdevg/Ascendcopdevg/atlas_ascendc_map_10_0017.html), presenting Cube and Vector operator execution processes through videos.
