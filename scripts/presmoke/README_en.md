# Presmoke Watch Entry

`scripts/run_presmoke.sh` is the CI and manual watch entry. It runs one full 910B or 950 presmoke round, writes archiveable reports, and can retry timeout cases on other cards.

For direct Python CLI experiments, use `PYTHONPATH=scripts PRESMOKE_PROJECT_ROOT=$PWD python3 -m presmoke ...`.

Before a full watch run, the orchestrator removes all entries under the active CANN `opp/vendors` directory. This keeps custom-op package installation deterministic across rounds. Runs with `--filter` or `--dry-run` do not clean `opp/vendors`.

## Quick Start

Run with defaults. This is the shortest command and is intended to be compatible with the old `run_presmoke.sh` caller contract:

```bash
bash scripts/run_presmoke.sh
```

Default behavior:

- `ARCH=dav-2201`, for 910B.
- `MODES=npu`.
- `NPU_CARDS=auto`, detect visible `/dev/davinci*` cards and run them in parallel.
- `PRIMARY_CARD=0`, used only when auto detection finds no NPU card or for single-run fallbacks.
- `SCHEDULE=fixed`.
- `JOBS=auto`.
- `NPU_SLOTS=1`.
- `TIMEOUT=120`, applied only to NPU run commands.
- Success prints `execute samples success`; failure prints `execute samples failed` and exits non-zero.

## Common Commands

Check which cases would run without executing them:

```bash
bash scripts/run_presmoke.sh --dry-run
```

Run 910B on a specific card:

```bash
NPU_CARDS=7 PRIMARY_CARD=7 bash scripts/run_presmoke.sh
```

Run 950:

```bash
ARCH=dav-3510 PRIMARY_CARD=0 bash scripts/run_presmoke.sh
```

Run one case:

```bash
bash scripts/run_presmoke.sh \
  --filter 01_simd_cpp_api/03_basic_api/03_matrix_compute/mmad_unitflag
```

Write reports to a specific directory:

```bash
OUT_ROOT=/tmp/presmoke_910b_card7 \
PRIMARY_CARD=7 \
bash scripts/run_presmoke.sh
```

Run CPU mode explicitly. CPU mode is not the default:

```bash
MODES=cpu bash scripts/run_presmoke.sh
```

Increase CPU run timeout for slow CPU-mode cases:

```bash
MODES=cpu CPU_RUN_TIMEOUT=1800 bash scripts/run_presmoke.sh
```

## CI Commands

910B:

```bash
PROJECT_ROOT=/path/to/asc-devkit \
ARCH=dav-2201 \
PRIMARY_CARD=7 \
RETRY_CARDS="0 1 2 3 4 5 6" \
bash scripts/run_presmoke.sh
```

950:

```bash
PROJECT_ROOT=/path/to/asc-devkit \
ARCH=dav-3510 \
PRIMARY_CARD=0 \
bash scripts/run_presmoke.sh
```

950 dry-run:

```bash
ARCH=dav-3510 PRIMARY_CARD=0 bash scripts/run_presmoke.sh --dry-run
```

910B dry-run:

```bash
ARCH=dav-2201 PRIMARY_CARD=7 bash scripts/run_presmoke.sh --dry-run
```

## Parameters

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `PROJECT_ROOT` | script parent repo | asc-devkit checkout to run. |
| `ASCEND_HOME_DIR` | `/usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/latest` | CANN toolkit root containing `set_env.sh`. |
| `ARCH` | `dav-2201` | Target arch. Use `dav-2201` for 910B and `dav-3510` for 950. |
| `NPU_CARDS` | `auto` | NPU cards used by NPU mode. `auto` detects visible `/dev/davinci*` first, then falls back to `npu-smi`. Set `NPU_CARDS=7` for a forced single-card run. |
| `PRIMARY_CARD` | `0` | Fallback/main NPU card id when auto detection finds no cards or the run is forced to single-run mode. |
| `RETRY_CARDS` | empty | Space-separated card ids for retrying timeout cases. |
| `JOBS` | `auto` | Parallel build workers. NPU mode uses a conservative CPU-count ladder; CPU-only mode uses `ceil(CPU(s) / 4)`, capped at 64. |
| `NPU_SLOTS` | `1` | NPU queue concurrency. Keep `1` for watch runs. |
| `CPU_RUN_SLOTS` | `auto` | CPU-only run workers. `auto` uses host `CPU(s)` from `lscpu`. Ignored by NPU mode. |
| `MAKE_JOBS` | `auto` | Per-case `make -j` limit. `auto` uses `CPU(s) / resolved JOBS`; explicit `make -j` commands are capped by the presmoke wrapper. |
| `TIMEOUT` | `120` | Timeout in seconds for NPU run commands. Build and verify commands do not use this timeout. |
| `CPU_RUN_TIMEOUT` | `300` | Timeout in seconds for CPU run commands. Increase this when CPU-only validation is slower than expected. |
| `SCHEDULE` | `fixed` | Case submit order. Watch runs should use `fixed`. |
| `SCHEDULE_FILE` | built-in | Optional fixed order override. |
| `OUT_ROOT` | `presmoke_reports/presmoke_<arch>_<timestamp>` | Output directory for CI archive. |
| `MODES` | `npu` | Presmoke modes. |
| `MODE` | unset | Alias used only when `MODES` is unset. For example, `MODE=cpu`. |

CPU debug mode is opt-in. Use `MODES=cpu` or `MODE=cpu`; the default watch path remains `npu`. CPU mode does not use the NPU fixed schedule unless `SCHEDULE_FILE` is explicitly provided.

For CPU mode, the default parallelism is computed from the host CPU count instead of hard-coded for specific machines. For example, a 192-CPU host resolves to `JOBS=48`, `MAKE_JOBS=4`, and `CPU_RUN_SLOTS=192`; an 88-CPU host resolves to `JOBS=22`, `MAKE_JOBS=4`, and `CPU_RUN_SLOTS=88`.

## Reports

The orchestrator writes:

- `status.txt`: high-level progress and final location.
- `full_card<N>/meta.txt`: env, card, elapsed time, and `npu-smi` snapshots.
- `full_card<N>/stdout.log` and `stderr.log`: raw wrapper logs.
- `full_card<N>/results/report.json`: machine-readable presmoke report.
- `full_card<N>/results/report.md`: detailed Markdown report.
- `full_card<N>/results/logs/<case>__<mode>.log`: full per-case command log.
- `full_card<N>/results/logs/stages/<case>__<mode>__<stage>.log`: per-stage command logs for build, run, and verify.
- `FINAL_REPORT.md`: concise summary with failures and retry results.
- `ALL_CASE_TIMINGS.tsv`: per-case timing, NPU wait, step details, and executed commands.
- `FAILURES.tsv`: failed or skipped primary results plus retry outcome.

## Fixed Schedule

The default fixed schedules are:

- `scripts/presmoke/schedules/dav-2201_npu.txt`
- `scripts/presmoke/schedules/dav-3510_npu.txt`

They preserve the required custom-op ordering:

- `custom_op_static_lib` runs before `custom_op`.
- `parallel_ops_package` runs after `custom_op_static_lib`.
- `aclnn`, `aclop`, `onnx`, `tensorflow`, and `tiling_sink` run after `custom_op`.

New cases not listed in a schedule file are appended to the end, then the custom-op dependency order is enforced again.
The full watch entry enables strict fixed-schedule coverage checks by default, so stale or missing entries fail fast.

To regenerate a fixed schedule from a previous run:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=scripts PRESMOKE_PROJECT_ROOT=$PWD python3 -m presmoke \
  --arch dav-2201 \
  --modes npu \
  --jobs auto \
  --schedule npu-idle-min \
  --schedule-report presmoke_reports/latest/full_card7/results/report.json \
  --export-schedule scripts/presmoke/schedules/dav-2201_npu.txt \
  --dry-run \
  --report-format json \
  --results /tmp/presmoke_schedule_export
```

## Notes

- Do not run multiple orchestrators in the same checkout at the same time. A lock under `.presmoke_locks` protects against accidental overlap.
- The full watch entry cleans the active CANN `opp/vendors` directory. Make sure the CI user has permission to remove and reinstall custom-op vendor packages.
- TensorFlow cases that require TensorFlow 2.6.5 are intentionally skipped by the case manifest.
- Timeout retry is for timeout cases only. Non-timeout failures are reported and left for diagnosis.
