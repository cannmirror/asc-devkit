## 🚀 Overview

[Ascend C](https://www.hiascend.com/cann/ascend-c) is a specialized operator programming language for Ascend AI processors launched by CANN (Compute Architecture for Neural Networks), providing native support for C and C++ standard specifications. As a programming language designed for multiple scenarios, Ascend C not only focuses on **opening complete chip programming capabilities to support achieving ultimate performance**, but also enables flexible selection of the most appropriate API through multi-level programming API design based on project requirements, team skills, and performance goals, achieving the best balance between development efficiency and runtime performance.

### Design Goals

The design goals of Ascend C can be summarized as **"high performance, completeness, ease of programming, debuggability, and compatibility"**. Through minimal extension to C/C++ language standards, it supports both pointer-based C language development habits and Tensor-based C++ programming paradigms, achieving seamless integration with existing ecosystems while supporting efficient Ascend operator development and ensuring consistency in development experience.

We uphold the following core philosophies:
- **No silver bullet**: Different scenarios have different requirements for performance and development efficiency. A single interface cannot optimally adapt to all scenarios.
- **Progressive learning**: Beginners can start with ease-of-use interfaces to quickly verify algorithms, while experts can drill down and fine-tune, leveraging complex interface features to fully exploit hardware potential.

### API Levels
Ascend C provides three types of interfaces, all capable of achieving complete low-level programming capabilities:

| API Level | Language | Features | Target Users | Primary Use |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Tpipe/Tque Framework Programming API** |  **C++** |Based on **Tensor** programming<br>Unified management of memory and synchronization through Tpipe/Tque framework| Operator library developers| Based on framework automatic synchronization and memory management<br>Improve programming ease of use|
| **Basic API** | **C++** |Based on **Tensor** programming, providing **C++ basic complete programming capabilities**<br>Allocate Tensor through MakeTensor/LocalMemoryAllocator, manage synchronization independently| Operator library developers|Manage synchronization and memory independently<br>Match C++ Tensor development habits, support achieving ultimate performance|
| **Language Extension Layer<br>SIMD&SIMT API** |**C**|Based on **pointer** programming, providing **C basic complete programming capabilities**<br>Allocate memory through array[], manage synchronization independently|Operator library developers |Manage synchronization and memory independently<br>Match C language development habits, support achieving ultimate performance|


Additionally, Ascend C provides high-level APIs and operator template libraries to improve operator development efficiency.

| API Level |  Target Users | Primary Use |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Operator Template Library (CATLASS/ATVOSS and others)** |  Algorithm developers | Perform custom extensions based on typical operator implementations to meet high-performance requirements in specific scenarios | 
| **High-level API** |Algorithm developers | Reuse general single-core algorithms to quickly complete algorithm verification |


The overall logical architecture diagram is shown below:

<img src="docs/guide/figures/architecture_ascendc.png" alt="Architecture Diagram"  width="1000px">

- **Language Extension Layer C API**: Pure C interfaces, supporting array memory allocation and pointer-based calculation interfaces, providing a C programming experience consistent with industry standards and opening complete chip programming capabilities. Atlas A2/A3 supports SIMD pure C interfaces; Ascend 950PR/Ascend 950DT will support SIMT programming capabilities similar to industry standards and SIMD/SIMT hybrid programming capabilities.
- **Basic API**: Single-instruction abstracted C++ class library API, generally based on Tensor programming; gradually improving Tensor programming capabilities based on Layout.
- **High-level API**: Abstraction and encapsulation of common algorithms based on single cores, providing implementations of public algorithms.
- **Operator Template Library**: Complete implementation references for operators based on templates, simplifying Tiling development and supporting user custom extensions.
- **Python Frontend PyAsc**: PyAsc provides complete low-level chip programming capabilities based on Python frontend, and will gradually improve Tensor programming capabilities based on Layout, adding SIMT programming and other capabilities to achieve high-performance operator development based on Python interfaces.

### How to Choose Multi-level APIs for Operator Development
- **Based on C/C++ language development**: For details, see [Ascend C Multi-level API Selection Guide](./docs/en/asc_how_to_choose_api.md)
- **Based on Python language development, supporting complete programming capabilities to achieve ultimate performance**: Recommend Ascend C Python frontend [PyAsc](https://gitcode.com/cann/pyasc)
- **Based on Python language development, quick development verification, ease of use priority**: Recommend [PyPTO](https://gitcode.com/cann/pypto)

## ⚡️ Quick Start

If you want to quickly experience project build and operator sample execution, access the following documentation for simple tutorials.

- [Build and Compile](docs/en/quick_start.md): Introduces environment setup, compilation execution, local verification, and other operations.
- [Sample Execution](examples/README_en.md): Provides operator development samples and introduces end-to-end sample execution methods.

## 🧰 clangd/IDE Support

- Install clangd (recommend 15+, using Ubuntu operating system as an example) and VSCode plugin clangd

  ```bash
  sudo apt install -y clangd-15
  sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clangd clangd /usr/bin/clangd-15 100
  ```

- Configure local VSCode `settings.json` (example)

  ```json
  {
    "clangd.path": "/usr/bin/clangd",
    "clangd.arguments": [
        "--background-index=0",
        "--clang-tidy=0"
    ],
    "C_Cpp.intelliSenseEngine": "disabled"
  }
  ```

- Configure `.clangd` in the project root directory (example). The complete `.clangd` file is provided in this directory. CANN header file directories need to match actual installation locations. The default in `.clangd` is `/usr/local/Ascend`.

  If CANN is installed in a non-default path, or if you need to switch the NPU architecture macro, source CANN `set_env.sh` first, then generate a local config from `.clangd.in`:

  ```bash
  source /path/to/cann/set_env.sh
  python3 scripts/setup_clangd.py --npu-arch 2201 --output .clangd.local
  ```

  `ASCEND_HOME_PATH` is set by `set_env.sh`, and the script uses this environment variable to generate the real CANN path. If it is not set, the script prompts you to source `set_env.sh` and retry. The generated file defaults to `.clangd.local` and does not overwrite the built-in `.clangd`. To make project-level clangd config take effect, copy it to `.clangd` as needed and restart clangd.

  ```yaml
  CompileFlags:
    Add:
      - "-std=c++17"
      - "-stdlib=libstdc++"
      - "-D__NPU_ARCH__=2201"
      - "-DASCENDC_CPU_DEBUG=1"
      ...

  ---
  If:
    PathMatch: ".*\\.(asc|aicpu)$"
  CompileFlags:
    CompilationDatabase: None
    Add:
      - "-x"
      - "c++"
  Diagnostics:
    Suppress:
      - "attributes_not_allowed"
      - "decomp_decl_template"
      - "ignored-attributes"
      - "unknown_typename"
      - "undeclared_var_use"
      - "invalid_token_after_toplevel_declarant"
      - "missing_type_specifier"
      - "typename_nested_not_found"
      - "redefinition"
  ```

- Restart clangd (VSCode: Command Palette -> "Clangd: Restart language server")

- 💡 For any suggestions or improvements regarding ASC language syntax highlighting and code navigation support, community developers are welcome to provide feedback!
