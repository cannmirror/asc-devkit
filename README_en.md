## 🚀 Overview

[Ascend C](https://www.hiascend.com/cann/ascend-c) is a dedicated operator program development language for Ascend AI processors launched by CANN (Compute Architecture for Neural Networks), with native support for C and C++ standard specifications. As a programming language designed for multiple scenarios, Ascend C not only aims to **provide complete chip programming capabilities for ultimate performance**, but also enables flexible selection of the most suitable API based on project requirements, team skills, and performance goals through multi-level programming API design, achieving the best balance between development efficiency and runtime performance.

### Design Goals

Ascend C's design goals can be summarized as **"high performance, completeness, ease of programming, debuggability, and compatibility"**. Through minimal extensions to C/C++ language standards, it supports both pointer-based C language development habits and Tensor-based C++ programming paradigm, seamlessly integrating with existing ecosystems while supporting efficient Ascend operator development and ensuring consistent development experience.

We adhere to the following core principles:
- **No silver bullet**: Different scenarios have varying requirements for performance and development efficiency; a single interface cannot optimally adapt to all scenarios;
- **Progressive learning**: Beginners can start with ease-of-use interfaces for quick algorithm verification; experts can drill down for fine-tuning, leveraging complex interface features to fully exploit hardware potential.

### API Levels
Ascend C provides three types of interfaces, all achieving complete low-level programming capabilities:

| API Level | Language | Features | Target Users | Main Uses |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Tpipe/Tque Framework Programming API** | **C++** | Tensor-based programming<br>Unified memory and synchronization management through Tpipe/Tque framework | Operator library developers | Framework-based automatic synchronization and memory management for improved programming usability |
| **Basic API** | **C++** | Tensor-based programming, providing **C++ basic complete programming capabilities**<br>Tensor allocation through MakeTensor/LocalMemoryAllocator, self-managed synchronization | Operator library developers | Self-managed synchronization and memory<br>Matching C++ Tensor development habits for ultimate performance |
| **Language Extension Layer<br>SIMD&SIMT API** | **C** | Pointer-based programming, providing **C basic complete programming capabilities**<br>Memory allocation through array [], self-managed synchronization | Operator library developers | Self-managed synchronization and memory<br>Matching C language development habits for ultimate performance |


In addition, Ascend C provides high-level API and operator template library to improve operator development efficiency.

| API Level | Target Users | Main Uses |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Operator Template Library (CATLASS/ATVOSS and so on)** | Algorithm developers | Custom extensions based on typical operator implementations for specific scenario high-performance requirements |
| **High-level API** | Algorithm developers | Reusing common single-core algorithms for quick algorithm verification |


The overall logical architecture diagram is shown below:

<img src="docs/figures/architecture.png" alt="Architecture Diagram" width="850px" height="580px">

- **Language Extension Layer C API**: Pure C interfaces, supporting array memory allocation and pointer-based computation interfaces, providing industry-consistent C language programming experience and complete chip programming capabilities. Atlas A2/A3 supports SIMD pure C interfaces; Ascend 950PR/Ascend 950DT will support industry-similar SIMT programming capabilities and SIMD/SIMT hybrid programming capabilities;
- **Basic API**: Single-instruction abstracted C++ class library API, generally Tensor-based programming; gradually improving Tensor programming capabilities based on Layout;
- **High-level API**: Abstraction and encapsulation based on single-core for common algorithms, providing implementations of public algorithms;
- **Operator Template Library**: Complete implementation references for operators based on templates, simplifying Tiling development, supporting user-defined extensions;
- **Python Frontend PyAsc**: PyAsc provides complete low-level chip programming capabilities based on Python frontend, and will gradually improve Tensor programming capabilities based on Layout, adding SIMT programming and other capabilities for developing high-performance operators based on Python interfaces;

### How to Choose Multi-level API for Operator Development
- **C/C++ language-based development**: See [Ascend C Multi-level API Selection Guide](./docs/en/asc_how_to_choose_api.md) for details
- **Python language-based development, supporting complete programming capabilities for ultimate performance**: Recommend Ascend C Python frontend [PyAsc](https://gitcode.com/cann/pyasc)
- **Python language-based development, quick development verification, ease of use priority**: Recommend [PyPTO](https://gitcode.com/cann/pypto)

## ⚡️ Quick Start

To quickly experience project build and operator sample execution, access the following documentation for simple tutorials.

- [Build and Compilation](docs/en/quick_start.md): Introduces environment setup, build execution, local verification, and other operations.
- [Sample Execution](examples/README_en.md): Provides operator development samples and introduces end-to-end sample execution methods.

## 🧰 clangd/IDE Support

- Install clangd (recommended 15+, Ubuntu OS example) and VSCode plugin clangd

  ```bash
  sudo apt install -y clangd-15
  ```

- Configure local VSCode `settings.json` (example)

  ```json
  {
    "clangd.path": "/usr/bin/clangd",

        "--background-index=0",
        "--clang-tidy=0"
    ],
    "C_Cpp.intelliSenseEngine": "disabled"
  }
  ```

- Configure `.clangd` in project root directory (example) Complete `.clangd` file is provided in this directory, where CANN header file directory needs to be replaced with actual installation location, default is `/usr/local/Ascend` in `.clangd`.

  ```yaml
  CompileFlags:
    Add:
      - "-std=c++17"
      - "-stdlib=libstdc++"
      - "-D__NPU_ARCH__=2201"
      - "-DASCENDC_CPU_DEBUG=1"
      ...

  ---
  If:
    PathMatch: ".*\\.(asc|aicpu)$"
  CompileFlags:
    CompilationDatabase: None
    Add:
      - "-x"
      - "c++"
